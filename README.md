## Project Overview

This project replicates the final assignment from **IBM’s Python for Data Science, AI & Development** course on Coursera.  
The goal was to **analyze real stock and revenue data** for **Tesla (TSLA)** and **GameStop (GME)** using Python.

The project demonstrates:
- Extracting real financial data via **Yahoo Finance API** using the `yfinance` library.  
- Cleaning and transforming income statement data (focusing on **Total Revenue**).  
- Visualizing stock price and revenue trends with dual-axis **Matplotlib** charts.  
- Building a lightweight **dashboard-like visualization** comparing both companies.
